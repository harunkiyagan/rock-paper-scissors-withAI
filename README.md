## How to Run the Game
1. Install requirements:
pip install pygame pandas scikit-learn joblib

2. Start the Game:
python main.py

3. Play at least 50 rounds so the AI can collect data and learn.

4. Train the AI model:
python model_trainer.py

This will generate a file:
models/model.pkl


The game will now use this model to make smarter predictions.
